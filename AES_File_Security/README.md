# AES File Security System

This project is part of our term paper for the Cryptography course. It is a team project completed by **Nityanand Kumar** and **Pradeep**. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** algorithm for securing files through encryption and decryption.

---

## Project Overview

The AES File Security System is a Python-based tool that provides file encryption and decryption using the AES algorithm. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use and supports various file formats, including text, images, videos, and more.

### Key Features

- Encrypt files to generate unreadable ciphertext.
- Decrypt files to restore original content using the correct key.
- User-friendly interface for interaction.
- Supports 128-bit AES encryption.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AES_File_Security.git
   cd AES_File_Security

   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   Copy code
   python src/aes_gui.py

   ```

2. Enter a key (1-16 characters).
3. Use the GUI to:
   Encrypt a file (e.g., text, image, or video).
   Decrypt a previously encrypted file.
